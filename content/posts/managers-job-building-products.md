title: "The Manager's Job: Building Products, Not Just Teams"

For a few years, I worked as an engineering manager. When I first stepped into the role, I thought I understood what the job was about: build a great team, create the right environment, encourage people to take ownership, hire well, give feedback on behaviors, and then get out of the way on technical decisions.

I genuinely believed that my position and status should foster an environment where people could make good decisions themselves. So I stepped back from technical work, from product decisions, from architecture discussions. I thought that's what good managers did.

I was completely wrong.

## The Problem with "Team Building"

What I eventually realized is that this approach disconnects the manager from the actual work, from the actual product. You become this abstract figure trying to elicit specific behaviors from people. And honestly? It can feel manipulative.

From one angle, it's intellectually interesting to try to shape behaviors and create the perfect team dynamic. But from another angle, you're just trying to shape people into acting certain ways without being connected to what they're actually building.

The more I reflected on this, the more uncomfortable I became with that model.

## A Different Mental Model

Here's the thought experiment that changed everything for me:

Imagine you're the first hire at a company. You own a subsystem, or maybe the entire system. If you could achieve all the company's objectives by yourself, without hiring anyone, why would you hire that first person?

You wouldn't. Not for the sake of having a team. Not to practice "management". You'd hire someone because **you can't deliver the product alone**.

Then you hire a second person. Then a third. At no point does your objective shift from "build the product" to "build a team." The objective remains the same: deliver the product. You're just doing it through people now, because that's the only way to achieve the scale and speed you need.

The team is not the goal. The team is the mechanism.

## From Feedback to Critique

This shift in mindset has fundamental implications for how you work as a manager. The biggest one for me was around feedback.

I don't even like the word "feedback" anymore. It brings an excessive focus on the individual, and it tends to feel personal. Instead, I think about **critique of the work**.

If I hire someone to build a specific feature, my job as a manager is to critique their work: "The quality isn't up to par," or "The code should be more maintainable," or "The delivery speed was too slow and I didn't have visibility into progress."

I'm critiquing the work to get a better artifact, not trying to change who the person is.

That distinction matters. One approach treats people as projects to be shaped. The other treats them as professionals delivering work that needs to meet certain standards.

This extreme focus on the work itself makes it easier for people to understand that there is nothing personal. It's all about the code and the product, and with the right mindset, they will take on the critique and feel challenged to delivery a better product.

## The Skills of a Manager

Here's the critical part: you can only critique work effectively if you're deeply connected to the code and the product. You need to be grounded enough to recognize good work, and more importantly, to recognize when even your best programmer is cutting corners.

This doesn't mean you need to be the best programmer on the team. What it means is you need **good taste** in technology choices, in code quality, in product decisions.

You need to stay close enough to the work that you can tell when someone is riding that horse poorly, and show them how to do it better.

## Wrapping Up

The biggest lesson from my time as a manager is this: **your job is to deliver a product through people, not to build a team for its own sake.**

This might seem like a subtle distinction, but it changes everything. It keeps you grounded in reality. It prevents you from becoming that disconnected figure who talks about "the team" without understanding what the team is actually building.

It also makes the role feel more honest. You're not trying to change people. You're trying to deliver something valuable, and you need their help to do it. But to do that effectively, you need to stay technically competent enough to guide the work, critique it meaningfully, and challenge your team to be better.

I'm no longer in management, and I'm back as an individual contributor. Looking back, I wish I had this clarity when I first stepped into the role. I spent too much time thinking about team dynamics and behaviors when I should have been staying connected to the code and the product. That's the main reason I'm writing this: maybe it'll help someone else avoid that detour.

If I ever have the opportunity to manage a team again, I'd be a very different manager. I'd stay closer to the code. I'd hire for the product, not for the team. I'd critique work, not try to shape people. And I'd never forget the cavalry captain saying, because you can't lead what you don't understand.

That clarity about what the job will make all the difference.
