Hey! I'm Fabio, and I've been building software since 2011. Currently, a Principal Software Engineer at InDebted, where I work on scaling fintech platforms.

## What I Do

I work hands-on with distributed systems and event-driven architectures. My daily toolkit includes Go (my current favorite), JavaScript, Ruby, AWS, and whatever technology fits the problem. I've built everything from startup MVPs to platforms handling millions of transactions.

After spending a few years as Head of Engineering, I made the choice to return to hands-on engineering as a Principal. I love being deep in the code while also mentoring other developers. It's the sweet spot where I can have the most impact.

Most of my time goes to software design and testing practices, mostly because I've been burned by too many production incidents and also have learned from great mentors.

## Why This Blog?

I write about the technical challenges I encounter, patterns that work (and don't work), and lessons learned from building systems. It's just real experiences and perspectives from someone who's been in the trenches.

If you're a fellow programmer, I hope you find something useful here.
